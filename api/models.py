# 8 User Model
# We will be using the default USER model that comes with django.contrib.authÂ¶

# Username - Required. 150 characters or fewer. Usernames may contain alphanumeric, _, @, +, . and - characters.
# Email address - Optional (blank=True). 
# Password - Required. A hash of, and metadata about, the password.
# first_name - Optional (blank=True). 150 characters or fewer.
# last_name - Optional (blank=True). 150 characters or fewer.
# with this model also comes some attributes like is_authenticated, and methods like get_username, set_password, etc
