# 8 User Model
# We will be using the default USER model that comes with django.contrib.authÂ¶
# The user model has the following fields, the ones that we need are 
# Username - Required. 150 characters or fewer. Usernames may contain alphanumeric, _, @, +, . and - characters.
# Email address - Optional (blank=True). 
# Password - Required. A hash of, and metadata about, the password.
# first_name - Optional (blank=True). 150 characters or fewer.
# last_name - Optional (blank=True). 150 characters or fewer.
# with this model also comes some attributes like is_authenticated, and methods like get_username, set_password, etc

    # 11 now we can add metadata to a model, we need the class Meta
    # Metadata is an optional entity within a model and it is anything that is not a field
    # Some helpful meta data can include how to order instances, providing db table name,etc
